                Guided Imagery: The Beach
                {"\n\n"}By: Prentiss Price, Ph.D.
                {"\n\n"}For a few moments allow yourself to take several nice,
                long, deep breaths. Notice the cool air coming in, filling your
                lungs, and the soothing warm air going out. Just let all your
                thoughts float away as you bring your attention to your
                breathing... in and out. You might mentally scan your body and
                notice if you're holding any tension in your muscles. If you
                are, just gently let all that tension melt away with every out
                breath.... bring your attention to your breathing, in and
                out.... in and out... let yourself feel more and more
                comfortable sitting where you are.
                {"\n\n"}In your mind's eye, you see yourself descending down a
                long, narrow, wooden stairway towards a beautiful, inviting
                beach. Your bare feet feel the rough weathered steps, and with
                each step, you feel more and more tension gently melting away
                from your body. As you continue down the stairway, you notice
                how the bright white sand stretches down the shoreline as far as
                you can see. The ocean is a deep shade of blue with the fine
                white crests of the waves sweeping towards the shore. You reach
                the end of the stairway and step down, sinking into the warm
                soothing sand. As you rub the sand lightly between your toes, a
                soothing sensation of relaxation gently melts through your
                entire body. The roaring sounds of the sea's surf, the waves
                crashing over each other, calms your mind and allows you to feel
                even more relaxed.
                {"\n\n"}You begin walking slowly towards the edge of the water
                and notice the warm sun on your face and shoulders. The salty
                smell of the sea air invigorates you, and you take in a deep
                breath... breathe slowly out... and feel more relaxed and
                refreshed. Finally, you reach the water's edge and you gladly
                invite the waves to flow over your toes and ankles. You watch
                the waves glide smoothly towards you, gently sweeping around
                your feet, and the trails of sea water that flow slowly back out
                again. The cool water feels soft and comforting as you enjoy a
                few moments allowing yourself to gaze out on the far reaching
                horizon. Overhead, you notice two seagulls gracefully soaring
                high above the ocean waters, and you can hear their soft cries
                becoming faint as they glide away. And all of these sights,
                sounds, and sensations allow you to let go and relax more and
                more.
                {"\n\n"}After a moment you begin strolling down the beach at the
                water's edge. You feel a cool gentle breeze pressing lightly
                against your back, and with every step, you feel yourself
                relaxing more and more. As you walk down the beach, you notice
                the details of sights and sounds around you, and soothing
                sensations of the sun, the breeze, and the sand below your feet.
                {"\n\n"}As you continue your leisurely walk down the beach, you
                notice a colorful beach chair resting in a nice peaceful spot
                where the powdery soft sand lies undisturbed. You approach this
                comfortable-looking beach chair, then you sit down, lie back,
                and settle in. You take in a long deep breath, breathe slowly
                out, and feel even more relaxed and comfortable resting in your
                chair. For a few moments more, let yourself enjoy the sights and
                sounds of this beautiful day on the beach. And, when you feel
                ready, you can gently bring your attention back to the room...
                still letting yourself feel nice and comfortable sitting where
                you are.
